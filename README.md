# React Native AsyncStorage Asynchronous Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when working with AsyncStorage and how to properly handle asynchronous operations to avoid unexpected null or undefined values.

## Problem

When retrieving data from AsyncStorage using `getItem`, the operation is asynchronous. Accessing the data before the promise resolves results in undefined values.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that data access is handled within the `then` block of the promise, guaranteeing the asynchronous operation has completed before using the retrieved value.  Error handling is also crucial for a robust application.
