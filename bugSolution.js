The correct way to handle this is to always access the stored data within the `.then()` block of the promise:

```javascript
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  // Use the value here. It's guaranteed to be available
  if (value !== null) {
    console.log('Retrieved value:', value);
    // Perform actions with the retrieved value
  } else {
    console.log('Value not found');
    // Handle the case where the key doesn't exist
  }
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error retrieving data:', error);
  // Handle any errors during the retrieval process
});
```
This ensures the code using `value` only executes after the asynchronous operation is finished and the value is available.  The added error handling also improves application stability.
